                <h1>Photography Basics</h1>
                <h3>Fundamental Concepts</h3>
                <p>
                    <span>Composition</span>
                    As in visual arts, composition in photography is simply the arrangement of visual elements within a frame. The term composition literally means ‘putting together’. So, to get the perfect shot, the photographer has to organize all objects in a scene.
                    <span>Importance of Composition</span>
                    This may come as a surprise to many, but photo composition is as important as the technical side of a photoshoot. Suppose a photographer arranges the visual elements within a frame, complying with the rules of composition. In this case, a viewer’s eye will automatically be drawn to the most significant and interesting parts of the image. A well-composed shot will stand out from the rest and aid in distinguishing a great photographer from a good photographer.
                    To enrich images and make them more visually appealing, photographers utilize a variety of compositional elements. Patterns, textures, lines, shapes, forms, color, tone, contrast, depth, frames, symmetry, asymmetry, depth of field, viewpoint, negative space, positive space, and visual tension are among them. Read on to learn about the five basic elements of composition in photography. <br>
                    1. Shape is a two-dimensional compositional element of photography that can define a subject or a structure. It can be organic, like a person, animal, plant, or geometric, like a square, circle, or triangle. When different shapes intersect and overlap, they can unite to create a new shape. They can also surround an area, forming another shape. <br>
                    2. Form is created when the shape becomes three dimensional. This can be done by adding depth to a photo through lighting and perspective. Thus, when the shape and shadows collide, we see touchable contours brought out by the tonal range. <br>
                    3. Texture is a compositional element of photography that adds another layer of depth to an image, making it more real and perceptible. Texture itself can be the subject of a photo, such as an ice surface or patterns on leaves. Alternatively, texture can be part of the composition, adding dimension and weight to your image and giving it a sense of reality. <br>
                    4. Color is characterized by hue, saturation, and luminance. Each variable can influence not only the composition of a photograph, but also its mood. By experimenting with various colors in the frame, you can put visual weight on the specific part of the image. Black and white photography can help show contrast, highlight emotions, or emphasize key visual elements in your photographs. <br>
                    5. Positive and negative space. The scale and arrangement of the elements and objects in the frame affect the viewer’s perception of the picture. By effectively using space in your photographs, you can convey a certain mood or draw the viewer’s eye to an interesting or significant part of the image. Positive space refers to the subject or areas.
                </p>
                <p>1) Split Lighting 

                    With split lighting, the face is basically "split" in half with one side shadowed and the other side with light. Split lighting offers a dramatic effect to an image. To achieve the split lighting effect, place your light source (studio light, window light, sunlight etc) 90 degrees to the left or right of the subject. The line separating light and shadow will be down the middle of the nose and chin.  </p>
                <p>2) Loop Lighting 

                    Loop lighting is one of the most flattering lighting effects for any subject. Loop lighting is created when a small shadow of light (slightly "loop" shaped) is formed on the side/slightly under the subject's nose. The shadow does not appear directly under the nose, but slightly on the side, reaching in toward the side of the face. It can be small and subtle or can stretch all the way down to the corner of the mouth. To create loop lighting, the main light is positioned 30-45 degrees from the camera around the subject's side. The light source should be higher than eye level and pointing down toward the subject's face in the direction they are facing. An additional light source (fill light) or reflector can also be aimed at the darker side of the face to ease the shadows. Be sure to not place your reflectors down low angle up. This will result in an unflattering effect. </p>
                <p>3) Rembrandt Lighting

                    Rembrandt lighting is achieved by creating a triangle of light on the cheek. Rembrandt lighting is more dramatic (similar to split lighting) and creates a moody, darker feel to the portrait. The more shadow we add to our subject and the more we turn our light away from flat lighting, the more dramatic our lighting becomes!</p>
                <p>4) Butterfly Lighting

                    Butterfly lighting creates a shadow under the nose that resembles a butterfly! Butterfly lighting is also known as "Paramount Lighting", named after classic Hollywood glamour style photography. To achieve butterfly lighting, place the main light source directly behind the camera and slightly above the subject's head. The photographer will be shooting underneath the light source. You may need to place a reflector directly under the subject's chin (or the subject can hold it under his/her chin if necessary). This light pattern is a little more difficult to create using window light or a reflector alone. A harder source of light like the sun or a flash is usually needed to achieve this look. Butterfly lighting will create shadows under the cheeks and chin. Butterfly lighting is great for older subjects because it tends to minimize wrinkles! </p>
                <p>5) Flat Lighting

                    Flat lighting is the least dramatic of all the lighting patterns because it casts the least amount of shadows on the subject's face. Flat lighting is used mainly for headshots and glamour editorial type shots because it minimizes the amount of wrinkles and imperfections. To achieve flat lighting, place your main light in front of the subject in the same direction where you will be shooting. Angle the light so it appear 'flat' on the face. When using flat light, be sure to light from slightly above the subject's face as lighting from below will look unflattering! </p>

                <h1>Lens Types and Uses</h1>
                <p>1. The Standard Prime Lens
                    The Standard Prime Lens (or just Prime Lens) provides a fixed focal length. If you have a 35mm Prime Lens, you will only shoot in 35mm. The Prime Lens is most commonly used in situations when the subject is mostly stationary and you, the photographer, can move around. These include Portrait, Wedding, Landscape, and Streetscape.
                    
                    The benefits of Prime Lenses include generally higher quality images compared to zoom-capable lenses, lighter weight, great for low-light or night photos.
                    
                    The downsides are that, obviously, you CAN’T zoom in if you want to, you need to carry multiple lenses in most cases, and you risk losing a shot while switching lenses.</p>
                <p>2. The Zoom Lens
                    Speaking of Zoom Lenses, the Zoom Lens might be your catchall lens. Whether you’re at a sporting event, hiking outdoors, or in a situation that requires shooting far away and up close, the Zoom Lens can work for you!
                    
                    Zoom Lenses can come in different focal lengths. Generally, you might find a Zoom Lens that goes from 50mm to 200mm. That means you can get a nice family photo at the end of your hike (50mm) or you can get a close-up shot of that deer you saw along the way (200mm)!
                    
                    The downsides of a Zoom Lens are that they are usually heavier than Prime Lenses, not quite as sharp as proportionally priced Prime Lenses, and the aperture setting doesn’t usually go as low, meaning low-light shots aren’t as easy to get. When you get outside of Prime and Zoom Lenses, you start to get into specialty lenses. You would use a specialty lens depending on the situation you are in. There are typically 4 specialty lenses: Fisheye, Wide Angle, Macro, and Telephoto.</p>
                <p>3. The Fisheye Lens
                    The Fisheye Lens is commonly used for situations when you want to see a lot of scenery in one shot. Real estate is one of the most common uses, as Fisheye Lenses allow for a single photo to show an entire room (such as the bathroom). But Fisheyes can be used for landscape photos, abstract art shots, cityscapes, and more. Because of the nature of Fisheye Lenses (major distortions), they aren’t useful in most common situations, such as portrait or wedding photos.</p>
                <p>4. The Wide Angle Lens
                    Wide Angle Lenses are a compromise between Fisheye and Prime Lenses. They do as their name implies… capturing wide fields of view. Most commonly used in landscape photos or night photography, they do require a certain amount of post-processing (photo editing with software) to avoid some of the distortion inherent in the lens.
                    
                    They are lightweight like Prime Lenses and capture a clear image of most of the field of view, but aren’t useful for close-up, portrait, or when you want that blurred background (known as bokeh).</p>
                <p>5. The Telephoto Lens
                    On the opposite side, you have the Telephoto Lens. You probably know these as the lenses that cameramen use on the sports field to get those super close-up shots of the action. Not ALL Telephoto Lenses have to be that big though. You can get a decent Telephoto Lens that you can take on your nature hike to get those up-close shots of wildlife.
                    
                    They are also great for capturing that image with a great deal of bokeh (the blurry background). Imagine those shots of animals in the wild with everything blurry in the background. The downside of Telephoto is they are generally heavier, need a tripod to get the shot stable, and are expensive.</p>
                <p>6. The Macro Lens
                    Finally, you have the Macro Lens. You can use a macro lens for that EXTREME close-up! When you see a bee on a flower or the snowflake before it melts, you’re seeing a Macro shot. These lenses can give you the best detail for your money, but that can be a lot of money for a good lens.
                    
                    Again, they are specialized, so you wouldn’t use them in everyday photography or even in portrait/wedding shots (except for the posed shots like of the rings). Because they need to be focused so well, focusing times typically take longer than a typical Prime or Zoom Lens.</p>

            <section id="composition">
                <h1>Composition Techniques</h1>
                <p>Composition is a fundamental principle in both photography and design. By selecting and arranging visual elements in a frame, designers can create engaging and aesthetically pleasing designs. A good understanding of photography composition can help designers create designs that effectively communicate their intended message and capture the viewer's attention.</p>
                <h3>Rules of Thirds</h3>
                <p>The rule of thirds is probably one of the most well-known photography guidelines. It involves dividing your image into 9 imaginary segments with 2 vertical and 2 horizontal lines. The intersections of these lines and the lines themselves define the most important areas of your photo composition.

                    When taking a photo, imagine that the shot is divided into thirds and try to position elements along the grid lines and at their intersections. Doing this will result in well-balanced and eye-catching photographs. Some cameras even have a setting that overlays a grid over the image, helping photographers compose their pictures with less effort.</p>
                <h3>Leading Lines</h3>
                <p>The leading lines technique is all in the name — it's about capturing lines that lead viewers' eyes through the image and directing their attention to the essential elements. Leading lines can be anything from your surroundings — paths, roads, fences, bridges, trees, rivers, or sun rays.

                    When you're taking a photo, look around and examine the scene for straight or curved linear elements.
                    
                    With leading lines, you can:
                    
                    • Create depth and perspective
                    
                    • Direct your viewers' gaze from one part of the picture to another
                    
                    • Place the subject at the intersection of lines to highlight it and bring it into the focus of viewers' attention</p>
                <h3>Framing</h3>
                <p>Most composition rules aim at drawing viewers' attention to the most important parts of the image — and the framing rule is no exception. Framing is about using scene elements, like arches, windows, doorways, walls, or foliage, to create a frame within your photo. This technique adds a sense of depth and helps direct viewers' attention to focal points.

                    Framing allows viewers to peek behind the scene and learn more about the image's story. For example, pulled-back curtains or partially closed doors may create a mood of mystery or privacy. If you're having trouble finding inspiration with natural frames, take a different perspective and create frames with objects around you, like a ring or a picture frame.</p>
                <h3>Symmetry</h3>
                <p>We can observe symmetry in nature — in flower petals, starfish, seashells, or snowflakes. In photography, symmetry appears when parts of your composition mirror each other. People associate symmetry with proportion and balance and get drawn to comforting, visually perfect, and harmonious pictures.

                    The most basic symmetry type is bilateral symmetry, which occurs when the composition is divided horizontally or vertically into 2 mirrored parts. To create it, imagine a horizontal or vertical line at the center of your composition and make sure two halves of the scene look the same and balance each other.
                    
                    Radial symmetry implies more than 2 symmetric parts. It's often associated with ripples and involves the repetition of the same pattern in rounds.</p>
                <h3>Invisible Lines</h3>
                <p>Many things in photography remain subtle for the sake of art. For this reason, lines in a scene don't have to be actual lines like a road, the seashore, or a tree branch. You can create implied or invisible lines by arranging similar elements in a line, like pebbles on a beach or the shoal of fish, and let the mind draw the rest.

                    Some common examples of invisible lines include:
                    
                    • A repetition of elements, like trees, light posts, stars, people in a queue, etc.
                    
                    • A person's gaze or a pointing finger that makes us unconsciously look in the same direction
                    
                    Implied horizontal lines make the composition look stable and harmonious — for example, think of an alley of trees. Diagonals suggest motion and energy — think of an airplane taking off toward the sky. In turn, curved lines create a mood of peace, grace, and beauty — for example, a hilled landscape or a lily flower.</p>

            <section id="lighting">
                <h1>Lighting Techniques</h1>
                <h3>Natural Lighting</h3>
                <p>What is natural light in Photography? Natural light refers to the ambient light supplied by the sun or moon—not a camera flash or other artificial light sources. Natural light is also taken to include lights you'd find naturally in the environment, such as street lights, lamps, etc.</p>
                <h3>Artificial Lighting</h3>
                <p>While natural light is from the sun, photography artificial lighting is created by human. It is the light that comes from sources such as bulbs, lamps, and camera flashes. Photographers have a lot of control over artificial light, which allows them to produce unique lighting settings regardless of the time of day or weather.

                    Pros: You have total control over the lighting intensity, direction, color, and quality with artificial light. It's great for studio work, product photography, and any other situation where you require fine lighting control.
                    
                    Cons: Artificial light may be costly and requires a power supply, which limits its use in some areas. It is also necessary to have knowledge and expertise in order to use it properly.</p>
                <h3>Controlled Light Direction</h3>
                <p>The control of light direction is a fundamental pursuit in the realms of photonics and optics. This control plays a pivotal role in manipulating the path of light beams, with applications in telecommunications, imaging systems, optical sensing, and data storage. Researchers have explored various techniques for achieving this, encompassing mechanical, electrical, and optical methodologies [1]. Mechanical methods involve physically moving antennas or reflectors, while electrical approaches rely on phased array antennas and beamforming algorithms to electronically manipulate the beam’s direction. Optical techniques leverage principles such as diffraction, refraction, and interference to govern the trajectory of light beams. To date, numerous methods have been devised to control light direction, including phased array antennas [2], liquid crystals, and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) [3], spatial light modulators (SLMs) [4], photonic integrated circuits (PICs) [5], and metasurfaces [6], among others. However, these methods often come with their own set of challenges, such as high manufacturing costs, complexity, long switching times, or limited flexibility in redirecting light. In this paper, we use phase change material Ge2Sb2Te5 (hereinafter GST) for light direction control. This material has two stable phases with different optical and electrical properties between which the material can be repeatably switched in tens of nanoseconds [7]. We wrote 1D photonic gratings by phase transition and measured angular resolved reflection spectra to show the presence of a controlled direction of light. Moreover, we found parameters for structures erasing and were able to rewrite structures with four different periods.

                </p>
                <h3>Light Intensity and Quality</h3>
                <p>Light intensity influences a photo’s overall tonality. In most cases you want to have just enough light, so the photo is neither too light nor too dark. Portraits shot with low-key or high-key techniques are an exception here.

                    An exposure meter can help you to determine light’s intensity. When you’re taking pictures under permanent light (natural or artificial), you can make do with the exposure meter built in to your camera. But when you’re taking pictures using system flashes, etc., you’ll want to have a special external exposure meter.</p>

                <h1>Post Processing</h1>
                <p><span>Post-processing</span> is the act of editing and enhancing your photographs after they have been taken. Post-processing techniques include:

                    <span>Cropping:</span> Changing the aspect ratio or trimming the edges of your photograph.
                    <span>Levels and Curves:</span> Adjust the brightness, contrast, shadows, and highlights of your image.
                    <span>Color Correction:</span> Adjust the white balance, vibrance, and saturation of your image.
                    <span>Sharpening:</span> Making your image appear sharper and clearer.
                    <span>Noise Reduction:</span> Reducing the amount of digital noise in your image.
                    <span>Vignetting:</span> Vignetting is when the corners of your photo are darker than the rest of the image. This can be caused by your camera lens or by shooting in RAW. Vignetting can be fixed by using the levels or curves tool in your editing software.
                    <span>Saturation:</span> Saturation is the intensity of color in your photo. If your photo looks washed out or dull, you can increase the saturation to make the colors pop. Be careful not to overdo it, as too much saturation can make your photo look fake or artificial.
                    <span>Highlights and Shadows:</span> The highlights and shadows tool can be used to bring out detail in your photo that might be lost in the shadows or blown out in the highlights. This is a great way to add depth and dimension to your photo.
                    <span>Contrast:</span> Contrast is the difference between the light and dark areas of your photo. Increasing the contrast can make your photo look more dynamic and engaging.
                    <span>Remove Unwanted Elements:</span> Every photo has unwanted elements, whether it’s a stray hair, a piece of trash, or a power line. These elements can be removed with the clone stamp tool or the healing brush tool.
                    <span>Digital Blending:</span> Digital blending is a technique that can be used to create HDR images or to blend multiple exposures together. This is a great way to add drama and interest to your photo.</p>

                <h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
                <p>1. Practice.
                    Photography is a way of seeing, and showing how you see the world around you. Smartphone photography is popular too. On average, people around the globe take over a trillion photos each year — and according to research, 92% of these photographs are taken with smartphones. But you can make your photos unique — all it takes is practice.
                    
                    Take as many photos as you can.
                    Your phone is probably with you most of the time. This means that you can take great photographs anywhere and any time. So, instead of taking just one photo of a subject you’re interested in, take 10, 20, or even 30 photographs. Then, spend some time looking at your pictures to see which ones you like best, and why.
                    
                    Find different perspectives.
                    Taking photos from a unique, unexpected angle can make them more memorable — it tends to create an illusion of depth or height with the subjects. It also makes the image stand out, since most people taking photos on mobile photos are shooting images either straight-on or from above.
                    
                    Try taking a photo from a slight distance and playing with the sky as negative space, like in the first photo below. Or, you can try taking it at a slight downward angle.</p>
                <h3>Get to know your camera</h2>
                    <p>Get to know your camera.
                        It can be tough to take good photos on a phone if you don’t know exactly how it works. So, take the time to explore the different camera modes and settings on your phone. Get familiar with functions like adjusting focus and exposure. Many phones have automatic white balance, so you may need an extra app to get the features you’d get on a digital camera like a DSLR.
                        
                        Use a modern phone with a good camera.
                        Use a modern phone with a good camera. Invest in a phone that offers excellent camera capabilities. Think about resolution and low-light performance too. Brands add new technologies to smartphone cameras constantly, such as built-in telephoto and ultrawide lenses. So, if you’re looking for specific features you may want to do some research before buying. You can also use older phone technologies to create interesting images with a vintage feel.
                        
                        That said, if you are hoping to achieve high-quality images that meet the standards of your favorite Instagram photographers, a newer smartphone is more likely to bring you those results.
                        
                        Use HDR mode.
                        High dynamic range or HDR, is a camera app feature that helps balance the light and dark elements in a high-contrast photo. You can use it to give photos a more creative, or artsy vibe, but it’s commonly used to produce an image that looks more like how you see your subject with your eyes.
                        
                        Often with smartphone cameras, it’s hard to get the perfect exposure for light and dark areas. You could be taking a photo of someone in a shaded area outside against a bright background or in a room with low light against a bright wall. Setting the exposure to the background could underexpose the person being photographed. Conversely, setting the exposure to the subject could result in an overexposed background.
                        
                        HDR prevents this by retaining both the details in darker areas and shadows and bright areas. The iPhone takes photos in HDR by default. For Android phones, you may need to adjust HDR settings manually.</p>
                <h3>Learn how to use light.</h3>
                <p>Learn how to use light.
                    Understanding how to use light effectively is crucial for capturing captivating photos. The way you use light can completely transform any photograph.
                    
                    So, to improve your phone photography, figure out how to harness light. Try using the golden hour in the morning or evening for warm and soft lighting or create dramatic shadows with a harsh spotlight. And, remember to adjust the exposure to make the most of the light you have.
                    
                    Use natural light.
                    Natural light isn’t just for landscape photography. Take advantage of any sources of natural light you can find, even after dark. This gives you a chance to play with shadows or create a silhouette with other ambient sources of light, like windows or surrounding buildings.</p>
                <h3>Compose each photo</h3>
                <p>Composition in photographs is key. From Annie Leibovitz to Richard Avedon, the most famous photographers use careful arrangement of the picture plane to create powerful photographic images.

                    But you don’t have to be an expert to create unique and beautiful photographs. You just need to find a way of composing images that’s your own.
                    
                    Use gridlines to balance your shot.
                    One of the easiest and best ways to improve your mobile photos is to turn on the camera's gridlines. That superimposes a series of lines on the screen of your smartphone's camera based on the "rule of thirds" — a photographic composition principle that breaks an image into thirds, both horizontally and vertically, so you have nine parts in total. According to this theory, if you place points of interest in these intersections or along the lines, your photo will be more balanced and level, and allow viewers to interact with it more naturally.</p>
                <h3>Focus on one subject at a time</h3>
                <p>Focus on one subject at a time.
                    Composition is a huge part of what makes a photo great, but so is the photo's subject. Many of the best photos include just one interesting subject, like in portrait photography. So when taking a picture of a single subject, spend some extra time setting up the shot. Some professional photographers say that the subject shouldn't fill the entire frame, and that two-thirds of the photo should be negative space — that helps the subject stand out even more. But be sure you tap the screen of your smartphone to focus the camera on your subject. This will help make sure that your image is in focus and has optimal lighting.

                    Pro Tip: Once you've taken your photo, you can use filters and apps to make the subject even more vivid, or to crop it to frame the subject correctly. You can also adjust the brightness, contrast, and saturation of the photo — all from your phone.
                    
                    Play around with color blocking.
                    Color blocking can help to highlight the elements of a photo that you want to stand out, like a plant or something else with a bold hue. It achieves a similar goal as negative space, in that it can help a single subject stand out — but with color blocking, the photo's other elements stay intact for a cohesive image.</p>
                <h3>Finding Inspiration</h3>
                <p>Today's phone cameras automatically focus on the foreground of your frame, but not every picture you take on your phone has an obvious subject. To adjust where you want your camera lens to focus, open your camera app and tap the screen where you want to sharpen the view. If you're taking a photo of something in motion, for example, it can be difficult for your camera to follow this subject and refocus as needed. Tap the screen to correct your phone camera's focus just before snapping the picture to ensure the moving subject has as much focus as possible. A square or circular icon should then appear on your camera screen, shifting the focus of your shot to all of the content inside that icon.

                    Avoid zooming in.
                    When you take a photo from a distance, it's tempting to zoom in on something specific you're trying to capture. But it's actually better not to zoom in — doing so can make the photo appear grainy, blurry, or pixelated.
                    
                    Instead, try to get closer to your subject — unless it's a wild animal, in which case we would advise keeping your distance — or take the photo from a default distance, and crop it later on. That way, you won't compromise quality, and it's easier to play around or optimize a larger image.
                    
                    Keep an eye out for repetitive patterns.
                    Repetitive patterns are pleasing to the eye — they appear whenever strong graphic elements repeat over and over again, like lines, geometric shapes, forms, and colors. These patterns can make a strong visual impact, and photographing something like a beautiful, tiled floor can be enough to create a striking image. Other times, it's more fun to keep an eye out for where they appear naturally or unintentionally, like in the photo below.</p>
                    <h3>Hold your phone still</h3>
                    <p>Hold your phone still.
                        While smartphones have given us the benefit of taking pictures on the go, the cameras on our phones are still sensitive to movement. To help avoid blurry or warped photos, steady your camera first.
                        
                        You can lean on a friend or wall to prevent your arms or hands from wobbling, or prop your phone up using books or similar objects to steady your phone. Mobile devices make it easy to snap any photo on the go. But there's never been an easy way to make sure the shot stays level and balanced when you shoot — especially if you want to be in the picture and not just take a typical selfie with your extended arm.

                        Mobile tripods give you the freedom to mount your smartphone for quick hands-free shots without lugging any heavy equipment with you. Most mobile tripods are barely bigger than your mobile device and can bend to any angle. Learn how these miniature tripods can help enhance your mobile video experience below.</p>
                    <h3>Experiment with exposure</h3>
                    <p>Experiment with exposure.
                        Another mobile camera feature you'll want to set manually is your exposure. Tapping your screen when your phone's camera is on doesn't just refocus the lens on a new subject — it also automatically adjusts how much light the camera lets in. This, too, won't always look just right. It's best to adjust it by hand.
                        
                        To change your mobile camera's exposure by hand, open your camera app and tap the screen. When you see the lens refocus, you'll see a very small sun icon and a vertical scale. Slowly swipe your finger up and down this scale to adjust the light level.
                        
                        Capture small details.
                        You may have heard the phrase, "It's the little things." Sometimes, that also applies to photos. Close-up images that capture small, intricate, and delicate details can make for really compelling visual content. It can be tricky to photograph close-up objects with a smartphone. To focus on an object, tap the area you’re trying to capture. If you’re unable to focus the image, move slightly away. You can also tap another part of the screen, then go back to your subject to try focusing again. iPhone 13 and later also have a "macro" mode that can help with close-up shots.

                        Pro Tip: Use the "sharpen" tool in your favorite photo editing app to (conservatively) sharpen the details of your photo.
                        
                        Embrace negative space.
                        "Negative space" simply refers to the areas around and between the subjects of an image — and it can take a photo from "good" to "great."
                        
                        When you include a lot of empty space in a photo, your subject will stand out more and evoke a stronger reaction from your viewer. And what does negative space look like? It's often a large expanse of open sky, an empty field, a large wall, or water, as in the example below.</p>

                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                <p><span>1. What types of photography do you do?</span>
                    Some photographers do a little of everything. Others specialize in one type of photography or another. The first thing that people are going to want to know is what kind of services you offer. If they’re looking for a family photographer or someone to do their son’s senior portraits, for example, they wouldn’t want to work with a wedding photographer. 
                    
                    Make sure that you list all the different types of sessions or services you can provide, as well as anything you’re willing to discuss on a case-by-case basis. This is your chance to educate people, but also encourage them to reach out to you to discuss what they need and how you can help. </p>
                <p><span>2. Why should I hire a professional photographer?</span>
                    This is the million-dollar question. People want to know exactly what it is that sets you apart and makes you worth their time. This is your place to make it known. Explain all the benefits of working with a professional, including the fact that you won’t have to worry about one of your family members or friends missing out on whatever event is being captured because they’re the one manning the camera. Explain that you have experience in producing high-quality images that will last a lifetime and create wonderful memories and take advantage of this opportunity to link to testimonials to seal the deal. </p>
                <p><span>3. Are deposits refundable?</span>
                        If you’re like most professional photographers, you take a deposit with each booking to provide a little security and peace of mind. This holds people accountable and shows them the value of your time. What happens, though, when there’s an emergency or something comes up that requires rescheduling or cancellation? Do you keep deposits? Perhaps you only keep part of them. People are going to want to know, regardless. 
                        If you do keep deposits, make sure that you explain why. For example, a cancelation with less than 24 hours’ notice causes you to lose valuable time that you could be handling other sessions. It doesn’t give you enough time to re-book or find another client, so keeping the deposit would be understandable in this situation. </p>
                <p><span>4. When will we get our finished prints?</span>
                    Here’s another common question that we see. People are impatient and they want their finished product as soon as possible. They often don’t understand the time-consuming process of editing and proofing photos before they can be delivered to the client. Make sure that you not only explain how long clients should expect to wait, but why the wait takes that much time so that they are aware of what they are paying for—your professional expertise. 6.
                    If you’re not in the habit of backing up images regularly, now would be a good time to start. Technology is great, but everyone knows it’s not always reliable. It’s better to be prepared and offer peace of mind to your clients as well as yourself. 
                <p><span>5. Do you include digital images?</span>
                    Today, people often want digital copies of photos along with or even instead of physical photos. Moreover, some photographers only work with certain mediums in the same regard, for one reason or another. Therefore, most people will ask if digital images are available if they want them. However, they may not always be an option. Be sure to advise as to whether you offer digital images with prints, instead of them, or in any other capacity. If you do not provide digital image copies for any reason, explain that here so that clients understand your reasoning. 
                    </p>
                <p><span>6. How much are your photography services?</span>
                    This might seem like it’s too open-ended for an FAQ page, but that’s the genius of it—it allows you a little room to market your services and link to your pricing page so that you can convert more leads and generate more website traffic. In this answer, you should advise on how your rate structure works, whether you charge hourly, per session, or by the event, if packages are available, and so forth. Give people a condensed version of your pricing page, and then use the opportunity to link to that page for people who want more information. 
                    </p>
                <p><span>7. What’s your cancellation/rescheduling policy?</span>
                    No one likes a cancellation, but sometimes things happen. Therefore, you’ll need to make sure that you have contingency plans in place and that you can share them with your clients and potential clients. Be clear about what is expected, how much notice is required, and what the terms are for last-minute emergencies and other potential hiccups. If you allow rescheduling or accept last-minute cancellations with a fee, this is the place to spell that out. Make it clear what you require and expect from people so that there is no confusion. As a bonus, invite them to contact you to discuss their scheduling issues before making any decisions. It may not create any better solutions, but it shows your willingness to work with them. 
                    </p>
                <p><span>8. How long will our session take?</span>
                    People are always worried about time. They want to know you’re not going to take too much of it, but also that they’ll get every second that they pay for. It’s a balancing act, but again this is about providing information more than actually giving a specific timeline. If you have a time for certain sessions, list that here. For example, you might offer two hours for senior portrait sessions, while wedding photography sessions might be booked as all-day events. Reassure people that they’ll get the time and attention that they deserve, but that you won’t overstay your welcome or drag the process out longer than necessary. More than an actual time, that’s what they want to hear.
                    </p>
                <p><span>9. Do you backup or otherwise secure images for protection?</span>
                    Today, digital photography has changed the game entirely. One way that it has created some concern is in the realm of backing up images or securing files against various events or problems. People want to know that they’re going to get the end product that they are paying for, despite what could happen along the way. Explain your backup process and how you secure images between shoots, editing, and delivery to keep them safe and guarantee that nothing goes wrong. 
                    </p>
                <p><span>10. Do I get the copyright/ownership of my photos?</span>
                    Ownership is a big topic in the world of photography. You’ll want to make sure that you explain the process of delivering images, including who retains ownership, whether people have the right to copy or make additional prints, and so forth. If you keep the raw image files and don’t provide them, explain why. Make sure that you’re completely transparent about what your clients get when they work with you so that they can make an educated decision. You don’t necessarily have to give up the copyright; a proper explanation is sometimes all that people need. </p>
